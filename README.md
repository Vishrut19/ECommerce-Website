This project is a basic ECommerce Website Model using React,Typescript,GraphQL, which consists of many functionalities such as :
- It has category page for different category products like Tech,Clothes etc.
- It has a dropdown for different currency and the value changes according to different currency selection.
- A product view page.
- A cart view, checkout and a mini cart view page too.

This was a Junior React Developer Test Task for an organisation which was to be built according to the below ðŸ‘‡ mentioned specifications.

During the development process, I used:
 - React+Typescript
 - Redux-Toolkit
 - GraphQL (@tilework/opus)

 As it was a organisation's task so the GraphQL end-point was provided by them.
 
 The project was completed in accordance with the requirements:
 
 ## Required:

- React. 
- Class components.
- Create-react-app to scaffold the application.

## Allowed:

- State management libraries (e.g. Redux, Recoil)
- CSS-in-JS approach allowers (e.g. styled-components)

## Prohibited:

- UI libraries (e.g. Tailwind, Material UI, Ant Design)
- Functional components, due to the reasons described above.

# How to Run :
- First Clone the Project Folder using command
``` 
git clone repository name
``` 
- Then clone the GraphQL end point whose link is provided here : https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint and run the below mentioned commands:
```
    yarn install
```
Then
```
    yarn build
```
Then
```
    yarn start
```

- After all these steps you can run the project using the following commands :

```
    npm install
```
Then 
```
    npm start
```

- After all this just click and open the deployment server 
```
    http://localhost:3000
```

## Future Prospect :

- Those who are interested can contribute to this project.
- In future planning to add more and more functionalities.
- In future planning to add dummy payment gateway also.
